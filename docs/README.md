# Notebooks as a guide

For now, given that this tool is meant to fit within the [Llama Index](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) framework - documentation on Koda Retriever will be found in these notebooks.
The patterns and pre-requistes are almost entirely Llama Index based, so you may need to [start with Llama Index](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/querying/retriever/root.html) before really taking advantage of this retriever.

For now, the following guides exist:
- [Alpha Tuning](alpha_tuning.ipynb): Showcases a (simple) example on how to provide custom categories/alpha values for alpha tuning.
- [Quickstart](quickstart.ipynb): A quickstart notebook showing how Koda Retriever functions with default values and basic fixtures.

Both are recommended to review. More notebooks will be added as this project grows.
